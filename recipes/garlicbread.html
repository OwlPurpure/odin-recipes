        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>60g butter, softened</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>1 part-baked white baguette (about 150g)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Use kitchen scissors to snip the bacon into small pieces, or use a sharp knife to chop it on a chopping board. Add the bacon to the pan and cook for just a few mins until starting to turn golden. Add the onion, celery and carrot, and cook over a medium heat for 5 mins, stirring occasionally, until softened.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Slice the baguette into about 12 slices but not all the way through, leaving the base intact to hold it together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the cling film from the butter and thinly slice on a chopping board. Press each butter slice between the slices of bread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrap the baguette in foil, place on a tray and bake for 5-6 mins, then peel back the foil. Cook for a further 4-5 mins to crisp up.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
